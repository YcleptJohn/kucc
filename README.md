# KUCC - Modernised
The rebuilt KUCC website using Node.js

This is an experimental project in re-creating the KUCC (Kent University Caving Club) website in Node.js, whilst toying with alternative UI libraries to build up a better breadth of understanding than just bootstrap - settling on use of Semantic UI via Semantic React. There is also some time invested in implementing Stripe as a payment provider to learn more about e-commerce handling.
